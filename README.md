# Movie-SPA (Single Page Application)
A single page application shows everything important to a website on an individual page.  Links that appear take the user to places on the page itself rather than navigating to another page or another site.

##Links
Links that appear on this single page take the user to important parts of the page.  This could include things like headers, forms, or other important content.  Clicking a link to navigate to another part of the page helps the user skip some of the scrolling, which is helpful if the page is long/contains a good deal of content.

##Single-Page Application
Because of the ease of navigation, a simple site with little content can be kept to a single page without frustrating the user.  A single page also loads faster because there is not a great deal of data the site it fetching.  This format would be useful for simple donation forms, a business start-up, non-profits that only have a few products, and more.

##Use
Open the index.html file in the browser to view and utilize the links. Open index.html and styles.css in VS Code to personalize the page.

##Future Improvements
Future improvments could include: add a payment gateway; add additional genres and titles; adjust the appearance of the form so it is more streamlined; etc.
